# Getting Started with Scope Search frontend

To get the frontend up and running, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Steps

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory where the frontend code is located.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, start the development server using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run electron:dev
   ```

5. The application should now be running, and you can access it locally.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that you're using a compatible version of Node.js. You can check your Node.js version with:

```bash
node -v
```

If problems persist, refer to the project's documentation or seek help in the community forums.
