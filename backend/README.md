# Getting Started with Scope Search Backend

To get the backend up and running, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python (version 3 or higher) installed on your machine.

## Steps

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, start the Flask application using the following command:

   ```bash
   flask --app backend/main --debug run
   ```

5. The backend should now be running locally.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that you're using a compatible version of Python. You can check your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```

If problems persist, refer to the project's documentation or seek help in the community forums.
